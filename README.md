# Cyber Threat Prediction System

This project aims to predict future cyber threats based on historical attack data specific to the system on which the code runs. The project includes data generation, model training, prediction, and mitigation suggestion functionalities, with the final script converted to an executable file for easy distribution and use.

## Aim

To develop a predictive model that forecasts future cyber threats based on historical data and provides actionable mitigation measures.

## Objectives

1. Simulate historical cyber attack data specific to the system.
2. Preprocess and analyze the historical data.
3. Train a machine learning model to predict future cyber threats.
4. Generate and save predictions for future threats.
5. Provide actionable mitigation measures based on predicted threat severity.
6. Package the solution as an executable file for easy distribution.

## Methodology

1. **Data Generation:**
   - Generate historical cyber attack data specific to the system's IP address.
   - Include details such as attack type, port, timestamp, duration, region, impact, success level, and protocol.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - Load and preprocess the historical data.
   - Encode categorical variables and normalize the dataset.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train a Random Forest classifier on the training data.
   - Evaluate the model using the testing data.

4. **Prediction:**
   - Generate simulated data for future predictions.
   - Ensure consistency of feature columns between training and prediction datasets.
   - Use the trained model to predict future threats.
   - Save the predictions and mitigation measures to CSV files.

5. **Mitigation Measures:**
   - Suggest mitigation measures based on the predicted severity score of future threats.

6. **Executable Conversion:**
   - Convert the Python script into an executable file using `pyinstaller` or `cx_Freeze`.

## Tools Used

- **Programming Language:**
  - Python

- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy`: Mathematical operations and array handling.
  - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
  - `datetime`: Handling date and time operations.
  - `random`: Generating random numbers and selections.
  - `socket`: Retrieving system IP address dynamically.

- **Development Environment:**
  - IDE: PyCharm, VS Code, or similar.

- **Executable Conversion:**
  - `pyinstaller` or `cx_Freeze`: Tools used for converting Python scripts into executable (exe) files for easy distribution and execution on Windows systems.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/GitNivetha/ChronoDefense.git
   
2.Run the executable file on your windows

## Usage

1. Run the main script to generate data, train the model, predict future threats, and suggest mitigation measures:
   bash
   python main.py
   
2. The results will be saved as CSV files in the project directory:
   - `historical_cyber_attacks.csv`
   - `predicted_future_threats.csv`
   - `cyber_threats_report.csv`

## Conversion to Executable

1. Install `pyinstaller`:
   bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   
2. Convert the script to an executable:
   bash
   pyinstaller  main.py --onefile
   
3. The executable file will be available in the `dist` directory.
